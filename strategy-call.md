<h1 class="join-us">Free Real Estate Business Planning Call</h1>
<h5 class="join-us-subtitle">Are you a hungry real estate agent looking for more?</h5>

<p>Dear Fellow Agent:</p>

<p>Need direction and focus to sell more homes?</p>

<p>I’ll meet with you one-on-one to help you write a business plan you can implement immediately to generate leads, appointments, and sales. </p>

<p>I know how challenging it is to sell real estate.</p>

<p>You have discount brokerages, competing agents, and hundreds of ways to get clients (all are not equal, I’ll tell you).</p>

<p>It can get overwhelming to stick to a consistent business plan that makes you money.</p>

<p>My name is Tom Daves and I’ve sold over 7,000 homes. </p>

<p>I want to help you sell more homes.</p>

<p>I’ll learn about your needs, goals, and why you started selling real estate. I’m happy to offer my insight on what I would do in your situation to sell more homes.</p>

<p>I will also share with you what we’re doing that works to generate leads and sales. </p>

<p>Once I understand how you like to do business that’s authentic to you (referral, prospecting, marketing, events, etc), I’ll help you write a business plan tailored just for you.</p>

<p>You’ll walk away with a plan of action, with steps you can take right away, to find homeowners who will list their home with you. </p>

<p>This will help you get the commission consistency and the freedom we all want from our business.</p>

<p class="section-title">Here’s what a few agents say about working with me…</p>

<p><span class="quote">“Here at eXp Realty with the Tom Daves team, he puts you in an environment to succeed. He holds you accountable every step of the way, pushes you and puts you in uncomfortable situations to help you grow. Personally, that’s been pretty impactful for me to be in those situations. It has taught me to be more confident and that I can do it. I couldn’t be happier to be part of this team!”</span><br>
<span class="author">- Jason Pendergraft</span></p>

<p><span class="quote">“The reason I was drawn to Tom Daves with eXp Realty was because of the systems that I saw were in place. I said to myself, “I don’t want to reinvent the wheel.” I don’t want to slug it out in the spirit of being an entrepreneur. I want to stand on the shoulders of someone who has a proven track record of success. I want to learn from their mistakes, plug into their system and leverage their experience, and I found that with the Tom Daves team. My first full year in the business I was able to sell 10.1 million in sales and that is thanks to the systems that I was able to plug into and the leverage I was able to utilize with his name, experience, and the models that surround us on our team.”</span><br>

<p><span class="quote">“One of the most important things about joining the Tom Daves team for me was his values. Not only does he have high moral values, he likes to instill them with us. He builds us up and builds our character up because he knows we are only good as we perceive ourselves. He has coached us and helped us have an attitude of excellence and remain client-focused. The whole reason we are doing what we’re doing is to give our clients the best service we can give them. He has taught us that there is always room to grow and improve. Tom has been doing this for over 30 years and he still grows and improves and he helps us with our own personal growth.”</span><br>

<p>You don’t need to pay a bunch of money to a real estate coach.</p>

<p>Why am I offering this?</p>

<p>I’ll help you for free in return that maybe, over the long term – and only if it makes sense - you’d like to learn more about working at our team or brokerage.</p>

<p>Let me be clear that is not the intent of the meeting. That’s another conversation for another time and only if you have any interest.</p>

<p>I also figure we’ll do business together someday and I would like to get to know you. I enjoy seeing real estate agents succeed. It’s fulfilling, and I love it.</p>

<p>I invite you to request a free one-on-one business strategy meeting with me. We can meet for coffee, or even if it’s more convenient, a phone call or a video conference works, too.</p>

<p>I have a questionnaire I would like you to fill out so that when we meet so I’m prepared to offer you specific advice. When you request a call, I’ll email it to you to complete it before the meeting.</p>

<p>Look forward to meeting with you. Let’s grow your business.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Tom Daves</p>
